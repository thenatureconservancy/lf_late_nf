10110_20_29,C,Late1:CLS,"Closed-canopy, relatively pure aspen stand (>10m) with large overstory trees. Fire frequency is highly variable depending upon site location and adjacent vegetation. A 60 - yr mean fire return interval ( MFRI ) was originally used for the model and results generally in overstory mortality. Reviewers recommended a 100 - yr MFRI, and that value was incorporated into the model. Aspen are always suckers. Suckering and recruitment might be impeded because of overstory a ux in transport, but are infrequently eliminated unless there are other root problems with the clone. Existing data suggest that aspen can persist in the understory of conifers as a shrub for relatively long periods of time (Dan Kashian , pers onal comm unication ). Browsing more than likely occurred on suckers in the pre-disturbance state and is likely to occur again post - disturbance. Further more , herbivory is ubiquitous across the range of this BpS ( Romme et al. 1995). Browsing is therefore consistently incorporated into the model. Without herbivory, this condition can persist indefinitely , with continued regeneration and overstory recruitment. The cumulative effect of sustained herbivory eventually result s in an open - canopy , mature stand due to canopy die-off and a lack of recruitment. Any reduction of canopy auxin transport because of mixed or replacement fire stimulate s the suckering response. Subalpine fir might be encroach ing into the understory, per reviewers of this model.

This is a transitional state caused by insect infestation , disease, herbivory , or interactions among these factors. Continued moderate to high herbivory prevents the recruitment of overstory trees. Native herbivory was added to the model. MFRIs for fire are highly variable .  An MFRI of 60yrs was originally used for the model, but was changed to 100yrs per reviews. In the absence of fire , this state transitions to conifer, sagebrush , or grassland dominated. This was modeled as a main successional pathway. Reviewers state that in the southern portion of this MZ , this would transition to ABLA instead of PSME. PICO and ABLA would occur in the lower, mid , and upper canopies. Fire would create suckers in the holes , causing aspen to persist in this stage. Fire might also remove some of the conifers. Reviewers recommended adding insect/disease disturbance at 0.005 probability .  T his was input into the model with little impact. Thus far there are no data to support the impact of insect/disease."

Lower density may persist for decades or longer when more stable conditions return. Stand differs from local starting C lass B condition in having fewer younger trees  and so a higher proportion of older, larger trees. This is due to thinning from C lass B. Older, larger trees can become decadent, suffer damage from drought, storms, etc. , and accumulate. Itâ€™s this stage that results. Due to mixed - severity fires from C lass B, stands in C lass C will be uneven aged but predomina nt ly older, larger trees, because individuals are long-lived and only rare reproduction is required to maintain density. Also, bur oak resprouts vigorously from the root crown when topkilled by fire, storm, and sometimes by drought. Thus, the same individuals persist, although aerial portions may be of varying ages because of resprouting. This allows for a renewed bout of reproduction. Without fire, this class can revert to C lass D."

Visually, shrubs and grasses appear to be co-dominant , with trees subdominant ; but , below - ground trees are starting to dominate site resources. Low productivity means root systems are very extensive and extend well beyond the drip  lines of all lifeforms , except tap-rooted forbs. V ery wide tree spacing prevents running crown fires ,  wh ereas surface fires and mixed - severity fires appear to have little effect . Mixed - severity fire, principally single-tree torching, may finger into shrubs and grasses. Late-development sites are dominated by widely spaced old juniper with an occasional younger tree. Grasses and scattered shrubs present but patchy with bare ground common. Site supports primarily surface fire, which are uncommon due to patchy fuels. All fires are relatively rare , with surface fires fingering beyond initial lightning-struck tree s . Single-tree torching may occur, but not enough to transition to another class. Fires may scar ancient trees. Stand dynamics are similar to classical theories of uneven-age forests. Trees may live > 600yrs. Juniper savanna may well have functioned much like the hypothetical model of a classic uneven-age stand. Nearly all disturbances would likely have been at the scale of a single tree or small group such that stand structure may have changed very little for hundreds of years. Distinguishing a mid-seral condition from a late - seral condition may not have been possible."

The understory vegetation is almost absent d ue to the lack of sunlight and heavy litter and woody debris accumulations. Current conditions where there are large Jeffery pine trees along with multi ple age classes of white fir suggest that , historically , there were low - intensity fires that maintained stands without killing white fir, but more recently white fir has become dominant in the understory."

Shrubs tend to dominate early and tend to limit greatly the grasses and forbs after about 10yrs. Scattered Jeffrey pine or ponderosa pine seedlings sprout but may take several years to dominate over the shrub community. Mixed - severity fires on a relatively small scale serve to reduce the shrub density enough to allow trees to establish overtopping the shrubs."
10310_7,B,Mid1:CLS,"This class develops after about 10yrs in Class A , when shrubs are very low or missing. Lack of shrubs may result when the seed  bank has been depleted in some manner such that no seed source is present following t he stand-replacing fire and most shrubs in the pre-fire stand are killed. A closed forest of sapling and pole-size Jeffrey pine or ponderosa pine develops and then stagnates. Trees have more height growth than diameter growth ; thus ,  they reach heights similar to Class C, but at significantly smaller diameters. The understory vegetation is almost absent due to the lack of sunlight , and heavy litter and woody debris accumulations.

Scattered shrubs are found in the canopy openings, but grasses and forbs are more dominant, especially in the more frequent return intervals. At the longer end, bitterbrush can comprise 15-25% of the understory cover. Frequent surface fires as well as endemic levels of insects and disease maintain this class indefinitely. The fires are frequent enough that understory seed production is minimized, seed germination from the seed bank is not stimulated due to insufficient temperatures (either maximum temperature triggers or heat duration), and eventually root stocks age enough that sprouting falls off and some plants are eliminated that way. Grasses and needles are the primary carrier of fire."

In the case of Class B, if enough time  e lapse s without disturbance, enough trees will reach diameter classes large enough to be considered late seral.  In the case of Class D, should enough time  e lapse without disturbance, infill results in a dense, multi ple -stor y stand. In both cases, the understory contains only occasional shrubs and widely scattered clumps of grasses or forbs.  Shrub mortality increases dramatically after tree canopy closure exceeds 25 -40 %. Needles and downed wood are the primary carriers of fire. On average, the diameter remains smaller than in the open forest due to competition, although very large trees may be present as carryovers from Class D. As with Class D, an occasional tree may reach as high as 50m, but most trees are closer to 25m in height.

It is expected that there is more of this generally closed canopy class for the present day (primarily associated with forest management practices and fire exclusion ). However, current climatic conditions and insect activity are currently ""unraveling"" the ponderosa pine component of the closed late - development class (becoming much more open from ponderosa pine mortality) and may be adjusting the spatial extent back to what may have been expected more during historical conditions for this type. Because of the ongoing ponderosa pine mortality in the Black Hills and in this vegetation type (USDA Forest Service 2006), the proportion of live spruce to ponderosa pine is expected to be increasing. However, as ponderosa pine remnants continue to deteriorate, spruce individuals may also be lost due to their susceptibility to windthrow."

The rocky soils don't allow the maintenance fires to carry through this stage; therefore, nutrients don't cycle, and weak/diseased trees stay in the system. There is slightly less canopy cover in this stage versus the other late development open stage. This difference is significant in terms of fire regime; therefore, even though canopy distinction is very small, the modelers decided to keep this stage. However, because reviewers disagreed with that concept, that understanding of this class was rejected and changed c over was changed from 31-40% to 41-50%.

Evidence of past fires may be observed, including charcoal and resprouting woody plants. Trees exert very little influence until later age classes . Replacement fire occurs every few centuries . Currently Russian thistle, an exotic, is a major post - disturbance component , but depends o n post-fire climatic conditions. Another increaser is snakeweed post-fire , given right moisture regime. Original modelers stated that there could be grass-replacement fires , but they don â€™t set succession back to zero ; it keeps progressing. Replacement fire could kill juniper seedlings . Drought maintains the class but doesn â€™ t set it back to the beginning."
10590_27_33,B,Mid1:OPN,"Young juniper saplings are increasing and growing. Grass and shrubs are still dominant. Grass species that would be present are blue grama , little bluestem, western wheatgrass , and  stipas . Pinyon seedlings delayed until shade occurs for better growth. Original MZ27 modelers felt that this stage could be maintained for a long period with frequent, low - severity fires, as well as erratic moisture and burning by Native Americans. Surface/low - severity fire occurs in this class because there is still juniper canopy cover that is perhaps not all top - killed. Mixed - severity fire also occurs because sometimes grass density is sufficient to result in pinyon and juniper scorch as well as mortality. Replacement fire occur s infrequently . A heavy moisture cycle increases seedling production, and juveniles mat ure. Drought occurs but does not cause a transition."

Gambel oak is also forming stand patches. Thinning effect for mountain mahogany due to space/nutrient competition. Very little recrui tment of junipers in this stage . The closed-canopy pinyon-juniper stands are more scattered or localized based on soil or geologic circumstances. There could also be an elevation or moisture gradient that influences closed-canopy conditions (Gonzalez, pers. comm.). Closed-canopy pinyon- oneseed juniper stands appear common in limestone soils, with surface bedrock or high amounts of stony surface. Similar occurrences have been in the Lincoln National Forest (Sacramento District, along Westside road) as well as Apache National Forest (north of Clifton, Arizona). The Apache National Forest site was limestone and also had a mix of Nolina , mahogany, and other shrubs, and occasional Arizona cypress mixed in, but definitely closed canopy. Rhyolitic soils may also support same kind of stands; not much underneath, but closed canopy. The sandstone- and basalt-derived soils appear more open; closed canopy is another anomaly."
10590_27_33,D,Late1:CLS,"Mature juniper mixed with maturing pinyon. Understory declining due to canopy closing. Small amount of fine fuels. Original modelers stated that , historically, would still be having cyclic understory surface fires ( s urface fire occurs every 30yrs, maintaining this stage), and herbaceous component still continuous, though not as dense as previous classes. However, all reviewers for MZ27 disagreed with this concept and felt it was more common in 1119; therefore, low - severity fire was modeled infrequently. There is a shift in dominance from juniper to pinyon. Pinyon would be susceptible to drought mortality, disease, insects. In the tree - size class field, DBH is defined by diameter at root collar for multi-stem species (JUMO). Mistletoe might also be influenced by drought , but not modeled due to lack of info rmation .

This class can express itself for over 100yrs with varying amounts of blackbrush gradually establishing after decades. A few examples of this that have been observed in the field are believed to be more than 60yrs of age.

10940_27_33,A,Early1:OPN,"Class A represents an array of early s pecies. Vegetation is very sparse . Biomass is low. This stage corresponds to the ESDs of annuals, early perennials, and blowouts. Class A represents a mix of annuals and forbs, some perennial grasses, and areas of sparse vegetative cover and bare sand, including blowouts and sand draws. For most years, this stage would be small patches. However, after extended drought, this stage could cover a significant portion of the area. (Some of the modelers wanted to have a separate blowout stage with < 10% canopy cover; however, because that is not mappable, we did not create that stage - - especially because there are blowout areas in current conditions, which would not be picked up if we defined our class with < 10% cover. Therefore, this C lass A contains the blowout stage lumped in with the other annual and forbs and perennial grasses.) Drought and fire might have been one or two of the main causes of this condition , so the area occupied by this class is likely to have varied considerably, expanding during severe, extended droughts and contracting during wetter years. The persistence of this class depends on continual disturbance that inhibits the establishment of vegetation. Long-term extensive drought as a single factor could lead to this stage. Otherwise, a combination of disturbances such as fire, hailstorms (questionable), and continuous grazing (combined?) could cause a transition to this stage. L ow fuel levels and areas of open sand tend to prevent fire spread and make fire infrequent . If this class is bare sand and there's a blowout, this stage could last decades. But what typically comes in, since we are combining this with the forbs and annuals, is lemon scurfpea and other forbs, needle - and - thread, indian  ricegrass , sixweeks fescue, and ambiguous penstemon. Other indicator species: blowout grass and Pacific peavine . There might be some shrubs coming in here. There might be some prairie sandreed and bluestem. For a moderate blowou t, this stage could last a short time up to a few decades . This will depend on size of blowout, type of grazing, and climatic conditions. So this year-end covers part of the wind disturbance and environmental factors. If there are good climatic conditions, this stage can cycle more quickly, so this was modeled as alternate succes sion . What creates the annual - forb - dominated stage is the movement of sand dunes and scouring from major wind events. Wind events are a normal occurrence. If there is drought, fire , and abnormal disturbance, wind events can create more or larger blowouts. Wind/weather stress in this class is referring to high - wind events , which occur normally. We're describing it in terms of area - - i.e. , 10% of area affected. But the fire and drought combined (not separately) is what creates the conditions to have the wind affect the class and reset it. Native grazers can accelerate or maintain this stage or slow the successional process, depending on when the grazing occurs and intensity. All of these effects occur naturally and frequently."
10940_27_33,B,Mid1:CLS,"Class B corresponds to the ESD blue grama /sand sagebrush class. This is the sand sage and perennial grasses stage. Class B is the mid-biomass stage. There is much variation in this class. As per NRCSâ€™s ESD, the blue grama sand sagebrush community might evolve with continuous grazing without adequate recovery periods between grazing events during the growing season. Blue grama and sand sagebrush are the dominant species. Other indicator species: prairie sandreed , switchgrass, sand dropseed , and possibly yellow indiangrass , sandsage , leadplant (questioned by some), w estern sandcherry , needle - and - thread , and many forbs. Sand bluestem, prairie sandreed , yellow i ndiangrass , switchgrass, western sandcherry , and leadplant are less in frequency and production than in C lass C. Red threeawn , slimflower  scurfpea , hairy goldaster , croton, western ragweed, stickleaf , lupine, loco , and milkvetch can also be present. Canopy cover for this class can truly start at < 20% cover, but for mapping rules, we changed it to 20% cover. So on the ground , please note that canopy cover could be very low even in this class. Canopy cover can vary dramatically, however, due to grazing, hail, etc. Upper - layer lifeform is shrubs, but <10% cover historically. Currently, you will see lots more shrub cover - - up to 20% cover - - which would be uncharacteristic. This class transitions to the high biomass sand bluestem sandsage stage after a few years under the right conditions and disturbance patterns and processes. However, under the right conditions, it can move out more quickly. T herefore, alternate success ion was modeled as well , bringing this class to C lass C, the high biomass stage. For this stage, fires were modeled as occurring but not causing a transition, as the sage and grasses resprout quickly. There was much native grazing occurring every year throughout all of the classes on the landscape. Not much documentation on this , though. Grazing periods were very short , and recovery periods could be 6mo-1yr . Herds followed green - up and rains. This doesn't remove the grasses. This recycles the nutrients and doesn't change species composition (as does continuous grazing currently). In terms of cover, probably not much departure. In terms of species - - departure - - more sandsage , blue grama today. Probably more shrub cover today. Currently, there is probably much of this stage on the landscape -- blue grama / sandsage , although that was not necessarily the situation historically."
10940_27_33,C,Mid1:OPN,"Class C represents the historical climax plant community in choppy sands/sands from NRCS ESDs, in part. This class corresponds to the ESD sand bluestem/prairie sandreed , w estern sandcherry plant communities. The historic climax plant community consists of tall warm - season grasses.

As per NRCSâ€™s ESD, sub-dominant grasses include needle - and - thread, blue grama , and little bluestem. Significant forbs and shrubs are P acific peavine , evening primrose, prairie clovers, leadplant , and western sandcherry . As per NRCS ESD, the potential vegetation is ~ 70-85% grasses and grass-like plants, 8-15% forbs , and 7-15% woody plants. Class C is the high biomass class. This plant community evolved with grazing by large herbivores (NRCS). Evenly dispersed bison (and other herbivores) were probably part of the grazing history in some years. Large herbivores typically congregate more in herds during droughts and disperse when resources are more widely ava ilable (wet years). Regular g razing was modeled frequently, and heavy g razing was also modeled as occurring on 5% of the class each year , causing a transition to C lass B. Fire and continuous grazing combined without adequate recovery periods could shift this community toward the annual and forb stage or the perennial grass and sage stage. That would be the only way to remove the bluestem component temporarily. Lack of fire and grazing could shift this community to an uncharacteristic excessive litter plant community."

There might be some shrubs coming in here. There might be some prairie sandreed and bluestem. For a moderate blowout , this stage could last a few decades. This will depend on size of blowout, type of grazing, and climatic conditions.  So this year-end covers part of the wind disturbance and environmental factors. If there are good climatic conditions, this stage can cycle more quickly, so this was modeled as alternate succe ssion . What creates the annual - forb - dominated stage is the movement of sand dunes and scouring from major wind events. Wind events are a normal occurrence. If there is drought, fire , and abnormal disturbance, wind events can create more or larger blowouts. Wind/weather stress in this class is referring to high - wind events , which occur normally. But the fire and drought combined (not separately) is what creates the conditions to have the wind affect the class and reset it. Native grazers can accelerate or maintain this stage or slow the successional process, depending on when the grazing occurs and intensity. All of these effects occur naturally and frequently."
10940_31_38,B,Mid1:CLS,"Class B corresponds to the ESD blue grama /sand sagebrush class. This is the sand sage and perennial grasses stage. Class B is the mid-biomass stage. There is much variation in this class. As per NRCSâ€™s ESD, the blue grama sand sagebrush community might evolve with continuous grazing without adequate recovery periods between grazing events during the growing season. Blue grama and sand sagebrush are the dominant species. Other indicator species: prairie sandreed , switchgrass, sand dropseed and possibly yellow indiangrass , sandsage , leadplant (questioned by some), w estern sandcherry , needle - and - thread, and many forbs. Sand bluestem, prairie sandreed , yellow i ndiangrass , switchgrass, western sandcherry , and leadplant are less in frequency and production than in C lass C. Red threeawn , slimflower  scurfpea , hairy goldaster , croton, western ragweed, stickleaf , lupine, loco, and milkvetch can also be present. Canopy cover for this class can truly start at < 20% cover, but for mapping rules, we changed it to 20% cover. So on the ground , please note that canopy cover could be very low even in this class. Canopy cover can vary dramatically, however, due to grazing, hail, etc. Upper - layer lifeform is shrubs but < 10% cover historically. Currently, you will see lots more shrub cover - - up to 20% cover - - which would be uncharacteristic. This class transitions to the high biomass sand bluestem sandsage stage after a few years under the right conditions and disturbance patterns and processes. For the purposes of modeling, this class transitions out after 10yrs with no disturbance. However, under the right conditions, it can move out more quick ly; therefore, alternate succession was modeled , bringing this class to C lass C, the high biomass stage. For this stage, fires were m odeled as not causing a transition, as the sage and grasses resprout quickly. There was much native grazing occurring every year throughout all of the classes on the landscape. Not much documentation on this , though. Grazing periods were very short , and recovery periods could be 6mo-1yr . Herds followed green - up and rains. This doesn't remove the grasses. This recycles the nutrients and doesn't change species composition (as does continuous grazing currently). In terms of cover, there has probably not been much departure. In terms of species - - departure - - more sandsage , blue grama today. There is probably more shrub cover today. Currently, there is probably much of this stage on the landscape -- blue grama / sandsage , although that was not necessarily the situation historically."
10940_31_38,C,Mid1:OPN,"Class C represents the historical climax plant community in choppy sands/sands from NRCS ESDs, in part. This class corresponds to the ESD sand bluestem/prairie sandreed , w estern sandcherry plant communities. The historic climax plant community consists of tall warm - season grasses. This is the bluestem, sagebrush, prairie sandreed perennial grass stage mosaic. Other species include sand dropseed , threeawn , switchgrass, and Indian ricegrass . As per NRCSâ€™s ESD, sub-dominant grasses include needle - and - thread, blue grama , and little bluestem. Significant forbs and shrubs are evening primrose, prairie clovers, leadplant , and western sandcherry . As per NRCS ESD, the potential vegetation is ~ 70-85% grasses and grass-like plants, 8-15% forbs , and 7-15% woody plants. Class C is the high biomass class. This plant community evolved with grazing by large herbivores (NRCS). Evenly dispersed bison (and other herbivores) were probably part of the grazing history in some years. Large herbivores typically congregate more in herds during droughts and disperse when resources are more widely available (wet years). Fire and continuous grazing combined without adequate recovery periods could shift this community toward the annual and forb stage or the perennial grass and sage stage. That would be the only way to remove the bluestem component temporarily. Lack of fire and grazing could shift this community to an uncharacteristic excessive litter plant community."

During the 2017 review, one reviewer indicated that this S - class should be much shorter than the original BpS model, perhaps  < 5yrs, and that a mid-succession state may be needed to represent the increased grass component in t he mature shrubland until it is choked out by the shrubs ; this would increase fire behavior and likely the size of the fires.

Mixed fire or surface fires will tend to promote open woodland/savanna of older/larger fire-tolerant oaks by stimulating resprouting of trees and shrubs (e.g. Q. agrifolia trees with vigorous epicormic and basal sprouting and Q. engelmannii trees [ DBH>20cm or so ] with only epicormic sprouting ; if top-killed , they do not resprout ). Quercus agrifolia currently is reproducing better in southern California than Q. engelmannii ; as a result, more juveniles of Q. agrifolia have made the transition to mature trees. Mixed fire can remove regenerating shrub, tree seedling, and sapling component s . Surface fire influences the shrub/seedling/sapling layer by thinning and removing above - ground shrub and herbaceous material."
11180_4,B,Mid1:OPN,"Comprised of herbs, understory shrubs, tree saplings, and medium-sized trees. Stands may vary in understory composition with herbs abundant in some stands and shrubs in others; stands will respond differently to fire depending on their understories, where shrub understories have higher fire  severity. Replacement fire severe enough to kill most overstory oaks is unlikely at this stage due to lack of enough fuel to generate a severe fire. Mixed fire or surface fires will promote open woodland/  savanna of older/larger fire-tolerant oaks by stimulating resprouting of trees and shrubs. Mixed fire has a tendency to remove shrub, tree seedling, and sapling component s ; it also can remove older trees that are shorter statured or have previous fire scars at the base of the truck. Surface fire influences the shrub/seedling/sapling layer by thinning and removing above - ground shrub and herbaceous material. Most medium-sized trees will survive."
11180_4,C,Late1:OPN,"Comprised of mixed - size classes of trees. Stand understory is generally herb-dominated while shrub layer is open, and in general the understory diversity and density are low. Replacement fire severe enough to kill most overstory oaks is unlikely at this stage due to lack of enough fuel to generate a severe fire. Mixed and surface fires are less likely than in Class B because understory is generally less dense. Mixed fire can remove tree seedling, sapling, and older tree components. Surface fires will maintain open woodland/savanna of older/larger fire-tolerant oaks by stimulating sprouting of trees and shrubs. Surface fire influences the shrub/seedling/sapling layer by thinning and removing above - ground shrub and herbaceous material. Most medium-sized trees will survive. Today, under Q. engelmannii  in savannas, the understory density of non-native annual grasses can be very high, reaching heights of 1.25m with virtually complete cover. The thought is that this thick mat of fuel builds up against the trunk , resulting in a fire scar in a surface fire. This leads to the tree being susceptible to mortality in subsequent surface fires. This high - density understory is generally only present in pure Q. engelmanniii stands to 40% canopy cover."

A reviewer noted that for perennial grasslands and most grass/ forblands today that are heavily invaded by non-native annual grasses , the opposite can be true: after a fire , forbs increase but grasses increase more slowly with time since fire. This class is typified by resprouting perennial bunchgrasses and an increased proportion of annual grasses and herbs infilling between the expanding perennial grasses.

11320_31_38,A,Early1:OPN,"This is the immediate  post-disturbance / post-fire stage or the very short-stature vegetation resulting from disturbance or heavy ungulate grazing. The fuels in this class are generally too sparse and/or too short to carry fire. A variety of forb species such as scarlet globemallow and curlycup gumweed cab are common in this class, and grasses can also be common. This class will have species that are grazing - resistant and low - growing and drought-tolerant. Common grass species include blue grama , buffalograss , western wheatgrass , and prairie junegrass . Fringed sagebrush can also be a component of this class. Prickly pear, man sage (ARLU), fringed sage , and broom snakeweed occur in this class. Abundance of prickly pear is much higher than in other seral stages. Other species are SPCO and ARPU9. This class was initially set to succeed to C lass B between 3-7yrs . However, reviewers questioned the low range of 3yrs . It would succeed in 3yrs only under favorable conditions -- unless the site is occupied by prairie dogs, and then it would remain as a prairie dog stage. It would increase in size during drought and grazing , and then it would decrease during a wet cycle. Itâ€™s a shifting mosaic of prairie dog movement and towns dependent on grazing and wet/dry cycles. If in a prairie dog state, then the class would last longer in order to transition out of it; however, this is accounted for by having a prairie dog disturbance in the model, resetting succession and keeping it in this class. This class was therefore set to succeed to B after 6yrs , as per reviewer comments. Prairie dogs probably occupied between 15-40% of an area during some time. Class A should probably have between this amount since C lass A includes both the prairie dogs and post-disturbance areas. Amount in this class would also vary by distance to permanent sources of water. During dry conditions, there would be more grazing near permanent sources of water. During favorable conditions, grazers would graze f a rther from permanent water sources. However, it would be difficult for prairie dogs to move into an area without some kind of mechanism to reduce the vegetation, which could be drought, grazing , or a combination of any (Jack Butler, USFS, pers onal comm unication ). Data from prairie dog towns (early seral, aka C lass A) suggest cover ranges from 0-80%. Height is most valuable measure of difference between early and other seral stages, but height in mixedgrass prairie often is not much greater than 50cm -- resolution of mapping may not be great enough to distinguish among classes. High, prolonged heavy grazing was modeled as Optional 1. This includes prairie dog impact. Drought combined with grazing was modeled as Optional 2. Drought alone was modeled as wind/weather stress occurring but not setting it back to the beginning of the stage. Regular grazing occurs on this class . Replacement fire occurs. However, reviewer questioned this interval, as this class and fire is driven more by wet/dry cycles. Most of this C lass A couldnâ€™t carry a fire if heavy grazing and drought are occurring as well as prairie dogs. Therefore, the interval was lengthened. Fire also doesnâ€™t set this stage all the way back to the beginning, considering the grasses would quickly resprout . It would take fire, grazing, drought to set it all the way back to the beginning. Drought conditions could force this stage back to bare ground and annuals. Historically, however, there was very little of the component of annuals and shrubs."
11320_31_38,B,Mid1:OPN,"Blue grama , western wheatgrass, needlegrasses , prairie junegrass , upland sedges , and little bluestem are common grasses. In some areas , species such as big bluestem, prairie sandreed are locally common. Western wheatgrass and little bluestem are the most common species as this class ages. In some areas, western wheatgrass forms dense stands. Common forbs include scurfpea , prairie coneflower, Rocky Mountain beeplant , scarlet globemallow , and dotted gayfeather . Prickly pear, man sage ( Artemisia ludoviciana ), fringed sage, snowberry , and broom snakeweed occur in this class. Also  Agropyron  smithii  is present. Cover in this class would actually range from 40-80%, depending on soils and weather for the year and the addition of the third class to account for abnormally long periods of low fire activity. Native grazing occurs , maintaining this stage. High, prolonged heavy grazing was modeled as Optional 1. Replacement fire occurs most of the time , not causing a transition back to the beginning but some of the time causing a transition back to A. After fire, there is probably also heavy grazing. Drought can also occur, but infrequently causing a transition back to C lass A. Regular drought could occur and not cause a transition (not modeled). With lack of fire, encroachment might occur after this class. Trees (juniper, chokecherry) and shrubs might appear with higher cover. This class was therefore modeled as succeeding within itself but having an alternate successional pathway going to C. It would be uncharacteristic to have > 20% cover of shrubs/trees."
11320_31_38,C,Late1:CLS,"The transition to C lass C would occur due to lack of fire over an extended period of time . This shrubby stage might occur more on the eastern end of the MZ s or in areas that are more protected from fire , such as ravines in the deep loess regions. Shrubs and other climax species would dominate with an understory of fine fuels within the unburned area. Where the successional stage includes shrubs, mixed and surface fires can occur in addition to replacement fires. Each type of fire can result in multiple potential successional pathways due to variability in fire intensity, severity, and spatial extent ( Twidwell et al. 2009, 2013). Grazing occurs that would cause a transition back to B on 2% of the class each year. Multiple disturbance pathways exist and are determined by the distribution of species on site. The disturbance pathway following fire depends on fire intensity. High - intensity fire can move closed - canopy juniper woodland to an early successional class. Low to moderate fire intensities can result in closed - canopy juniper woodland moving to a mid-development class or remaining in a late development class ( Twidwell et al. 2009, 2013). Replacement fire occurs relatively frequently."
11320_32_34_35,A,Early1:OPN,"Class A is early succession stage.

Indicator grasses, such as blue grama ( Bouteloua  gracilis ) and buffalograss ( Buchloe  dactyloides ) , will still be present but in lesser amounts than the climax community. Annual forbs such as broomweed ( Amphiachyris  dracunculoides ), ragweed ( Ambrosia psilostachya ) , and false mesquite ( Calliandra  eriophylla ) will typically be present early. In this early stage, grasses will be more nutritious and palatable , and grazing by bison, antelope, deer, rodents and lagomorphs would be common and maintain this class. Replacement fire might occur."

For MZ 32 ,  sideoats  grama ( Bouteloua  curtipendula ) and little bluestem ( Schizachyrium  scoparium ) are the diagnostic species. There would also be scatterings of black grama ( B. eriopoda ) and vine mesquite ( P. obtusum ) on heavier soils. Scattered shrubs may be present (up to 10%, maybe up to 1m ) - - honey mesquite, Ashe â€™s juniper ( Juniperus  ashei ), Pinchotâ€™s j uniper ( Juniperous  pinchotii ) , and lotebush ( Ziziphus  obtusifolia ), yucca (sandy sites) , and elbowbush ( Forestiera  pubescens ). Multiple disturbance pathways exist and are determined by the distribution of species on site. The disturbance pathway following fire depends on fire intensity. High - intensity fire can cause juniper mortality. Low to moderate fire intensities will likely result in this class remaining in a late development state. Given that one of the indicator species is m esquite, a resprouting tree, it is likely that portions of the land area dominated by m esquite will remain in the Late2 stage due to resprouting following r eplacement f ire. There is some evidence, however, that high - intensity fires conducted during drought can cause high mortality of resprouting woody plants ( Twidwell et al. 2016). In areas dominated by A she â€™s juniper, surface and mixed fires can cause high mortality and a return to early successional vegetation under ( Twidwell et al. 2009, 2013). Replacement fires occur more often in this class. Native grazing maintains this class. Drought, which by definition is not a permanent reduction in rainfall, is not capable of causing a state shift back to open grassland in this system ( Twidwell et al. 2014 ;  Breshears et al. 2016 ) Without disturbance , this class will succeed to class C."

Bison inhabit ~5% of this class each year and do not cause a transition. Fire might occu r, but infrequently; the small occurrences are due to low fuels. It doesn't set back succession to zero, in terms of modeling. Fire would be more frequent in mixedgrass than in shortgrass due to higher fuel loads. This class might move to the next stage more quickly due to higher precip itation levels. Modelers originall y kept this age range the same as the original interval as in the draft model for shortgrass for east ern C olorado and west ern K ansas MZs 27 and 33 . (B ecause of the mapzones of interest and similar large patch systems, modelers wanted it to be similar. ) However, because the draft model subsequently changed post-review, the time s pent in this class was changed . All modelers were informed and agreed. Prairie dogs are not as extensive in mixedgrass as in shortgrass in MZs 27 and 33. Higher proportion of this area wouldn't be suitable due to steeper slopes. Prairie dogs were modeled as Option 1 and  maintaining this stage. The composition in class A implies significantly different edaphic conditions from class B, not just fire succession.

Less common would be skunkbush sumac, mostly on slopes and shallow soils. Mappers - - please note that the vegetation in this class can certainly be < 0.5m immediate post-fire-disturbance. However, because we had to distinguish this class from B - - by something other than species (because species are certainly different in A/C vs . B), we had to raise the height of the herbaceous cover in this class. Class B will have shorter vegetation. Little below-ground mortality occurs after replacement fire, and resprouting of perennial grasses and forbs often occurs within days or weeks, depending on season. Grasses show greater vigor; some forb establishment may occur as a result of exposure of mineral soil. Canopy cover recovers quickly after resprouting .

11410_20,B,Mid1:OPN,"Class B is very short-stature vegetation resulting from prairie dog disturbance or repeated high - intensity herbivory or trampling (e .g., watering points and buffalo wallows). This class may also be a short - term response to severe drought, combined with other impacts (Optional 1 in C lass A). A variety of forb species such as fetid marigold, scarlet globemallow , and curlycup gumweed tend to dominate this class. Common grass species include purple three-awn, buffalo grass, Sandberg bluegrass, blue grama , and western wheatgrass. Fringed sagebrush can also be a component of this class. The fuel s in this class are generally too sparse to carry fire. Native grazing (bison, pro ng horn , and prairie dog) can be locally heavy due to increased succulenc e of young grasses keeping it in this stage. This was split 50/50 between native grazing and Option 2. (Note about identifying in current conditions: Long-term high - intensity grazing by domestic livestock without periods of rest and recovery can result in a conversion in the vegetation states from a mid-grass - dominated community to shortgrass - dominated communities (blue grama , sedges, and sanders bluegrass, buffalograss in southern portions, and junegrass ). This should be distinguished from this C lass B vegetative state that's influenced more by the presence of prairie dog towns - which have a higher forb component with less of a mid-grass component than C lass A or C. In species composition, the prairie dog v s. domestic grazed communities are very different.) Prairie dog disease co uld push this class to A. It is thought that this class should comprise ~ 5-8% of the landscape  and no more than 10% (Dan Uresk , pers onal comm unication ). Research for historical Northwestern Great Plains vegetation would have prairie dog communities within an early successional stage of max 10-15% across an entire landscape.

Club moss might be present on the Glaciated Plains at 0-5% cover but not on shallow clay sites or dense clay sites, sands, saline upland, saline lowland, subirrigated or wet meadow. Grazing is less frequent than in A due to palatability. There are more shrub-dependent wildlife species browsing . Insect/disease occurs very infrequentl y .

This class may also be a short - term response to severe drought, combined with other impacts (Optional 1 - - but causing a transition all the way back to the beginning). (NOTE: Previously, in MZ20, this class was defined as just a prairie dog stage with the herbivory/trampling and severe drought components - - and defined as a C lass B instead of A. But due to mapping constraints and inability of mapping to distinguish grass species and grass heights at a fine level and therefore a prairie dog stage v s. an early successional or mid successional stage, all early post-replacement and very short - stage grasses were placed into this C lass A.) A variety of forb species such as fetid marigold, scarlet globemallow , and curlycup gumweed tend to dominate this class. Common grass species include purple three-awn, buffalo grass, Sandberg bluegrass, blue grama , and western wheatgras. F ri nged sagebrush can also be a component of this class. Also - - this represents the immediate post-disturbance intact historic plant community functioning under grazing and/or fire, dominated by cool - and warm - season rhizomatous perennial grasses, as well as bunchgrasses.

Other species in this class are Artemisia , grama grasses, western yarrow , and prairie junegrass. Other species might include blue grama and western yarrow. STIPA, PSSP6 , and SCSC might also be indicators. Due to the combination of the prairie dog stage (indicator species: BOGR2, POSE, ARFR , and DYPA) and the early successional stage (indicator species: PASM, NAVI4, HECO26 , and BOGR2), the indicator species were combined for this class. Because this is the post-fire early regen eration stage or a prairie dog stage, this is generally a shortgrass functional group , which are communities dominated by species such as: poas , dryland sedges, blue grama, buffalograss, clubmoss, junegrass , and forbs either singly or in combination; may also be characterized by higher bare soil. This might be a shortgrass EVT. A higher proportion of this class on the landscape today would indicate departure. This class lasts only a few years . If in a prairie dog state, then the class would last longer in order to transition out of it; however, this is accounted for  by having a prairie dog disturbance in the model, resetting succession , and keeping it in this class. The current interval attempts to capture what would happen post-fire or post-drought. (Also - - post heavy grazing in current conditions would take longer to transition out of this class.) Native grazing (bison, pro ng horn , and prairie dog) can be locally heavy due to increas ed succulence of young grasses but keeping it in this stage. This was split 50/50 between native grazing and Optional 2, prairie dog grazing. Prairie dog grazing takes this stage back to the beginning, whereas grazing just occurs without causing a transition. Replacement fire occurs but not as frequently, due to lack of fuel . (Note about identifying in current conditions: Long-term high - intensity grazing by domestic livestock without periods of rest and recovery can result in a conversion in the vegetation states from a mid-grass - dominated community to shortgrass - dominated communities [ blue grama, sedges , and sandberg bluegrass, buffalograss in southern portions , and junegrass ] . This is different in species composition than a prairie dog community. However, for LANDFIRE  mapping purposes, it is not possible to distinguish between the different types of short grasses occurring.) Prairie dog disease is also a potential impact, but because prairie dog stage was combined with early succession, this disturbance was not modeled for MZs 29 and 30. It is thought that a prairie dog class should comprise ~ 5-8% of the landscape  and no more than 10% (Dan Uresk, per sonal comm unication ).

Other species in this class are Artemisia and western yarrow. Due to the combination of the prairie dog stage (indicator species: BOGR2, POSE, ARFR , and DYPA) and the early successional stage (indicator species: PASM, NAVI4, HECO26 , and BOGR2), the indicator species were combined for this class. Forbs such as galium boreale are more abundant in the immediate post-fire vegetation. A variety of forb species such as scarlet globemallow and curlycup gumweed could also be common in this class. This class will have species that are grazing - resistant and low - growing and drought-tolerant. Fringed sagebrush can also be a component of this class. Pricklypear, man sage (ARLU) , and broom snakeweed occur in this class. Abundance of pricklypear is much higher than in other seral stages. This might be a shortgrass EVT. A higher proportion of this class on the landscape today would indicate departure. The fuel in this class is generally too sparse and/or too short to carry fire. This class lasts approximately three or more years. If in a prairie dog state, then the class would last longer in order to transition out of it; however, this is accounted for by having a prairie dog disturbance in the model, resetting succession , and keeping it in this class. The 3yr interval attempts to capture what would happen post-fire or post-drought. (Also - - post-heavy-grazing in current conditions would take longer to transition out of this class.) The prairie dog stage would increase in size during drought and grazing , and then it would decrease during a wet cycle. It i s a shifting mosaic of prairie dog movement and towns dependent on grazing and wet/dry cycles. Prairie dogs probably occupied between 15-40% of an area during some time. Class A should probably have between this amount, since class A includes both the prairie dogs and post-disturbance areas. Amount in this class would also vary by distance to permanent sources of water. However, another camp feels that a prairie dog class should comprise ~ 5-8% of the landscape and no more than 10% (Dan Uresk, pers onal comm unication ). Research for historical NGP vegetation would have prairie dog communities within an early successional stage of max 10-15% across an entire landscape. So only a portion of the early successional stage would be a prairie-dog-type community - i.e. , maybe 5-8%. Data from prairie dog towns (early seral, aka C lass A) suggest cover ranges from 0-80%. Height is the most valuable measure of difference between early and other seral stages, but height in mixedgrass prairie often is not much greater than 50cm -- resolution of mapping may not be great enough to distinguish among classes. Regular grazing occurs on a majority of the landscape each year. Most of this C lass A couldnâ€™t carry a fire if heavy grazing and drought are occurring as well as prairie dogs. Therefore, replacement fire would not occur very frequently. Fire also doesnâ€™t set this stage all the way back to the beginning, considering the grasses would quickly resprout. It would take fire, grazing, drought to set it all the way back to the beginning (not technically modeled). Drought conditions could force this stage back to bare ground and annuals. Historically, however, there was very little of the component of annuals and shrubs. Because of LANDFIRE mapping rules, canopy cover is arbitrary number. These classes should actually be defined on the ground by biomass, litter, species. Very little of A, B remain on the landscape today; most is C."

Under these conditions, grazing is likely to be light. In lowlands, with finer-textured soils, primary production is determined largely by moisture availability. HECO26 was used as an indicator species for MZs 29 and 30 instead of BOGR2.  ARCA13 can resprout immediately after fire, so it could be present in this stage as well. It could, however, be killed following intensive fires. But since not much litter in these sites, possibility of intense fire reduced. It was originally suggested that there would be a prairie-dog - influenced stage at ~2% of the landscape. However, there was some disagreement as to whether this class should exist or not for this system, as it is thought that these sandy sites might have been unlikely to have prairie dog towns. It was only distinguished from A by different species ( Buchloe  dactyloides  [ only in the extreme southeast portion of the stage ],  Bouteloua  gracilis , and Agropyron  dasystachyum ). Canopy cover was 0-20%. This (very unlikely) prairie - dog - influenced class was therefore merged into the early successional stage, C lass A.

The maximum cover height for grasses would be ~ 60%, even though in other MZs , cover might be much higher. Other species indicators could be JUHO2 and SPCR - - in the later part of this stage. Various sprouting shrubs may be established. The shrubs are as tall or taller than the grasses, but they would not be dominant; shrubs might occupy ~ 10% of the area. Some of the shrubs include Juniper horizontalis and skunkbush sumac ( Rhus  trilobata ).

Canopy cover may reach 100% in wetter low areas. Litter accumulates , providing continuous fuels for fires , thereby increasing the probability of larger fires. This stage rarely persists more than a few years , but when it does, woody species such as chokecherry ( Prunus virginiana ), snowberry ( Symphoricarpos  occidentalis ), and smooth sumac ( Rhus  glabra ) may begin to become established in more protected areas. Since woody plants shade herbaceous species, some disturbance -- for example , fire or drought -- is required to revert this class to an earlier one. Replacement fire occurs, most of the time causing a transition to Mid Development 1 -- Open .  Roots of perennial vegetation stabilize dunes despite a lack of above - ground biomass , and grasses quickly recover following fire in this system, even under severe drought conditions ( Arterburn et al. i n p reparation ; Morrison et al. 1986 ; Bragg 1998 ;  Volesky and Connot 2000 ;  Schmeisser et al. 2009). Where the successional stage includes shrubs, mixed -severity and surface fires can occur in addition to replacement fires. With a fire - sensitive species like Eastern red  cedar , both surface and mixed -severity fires can cause a shift to the mid - successional stage , depending on patterns of variability in fire severity ( Twidwell et al. 2009, 2013). For this class to move back to Early Development 1 - - Open , fire must be followed by a prolonged mega - drought ( Arterburn et al. in p reparation).

The stages of the grassland are created and/or maintained by disturbances or lack thereof. Class A is the low biomass (0-1 in based on the Robel pole density/visual obstruction method), heavy disturbance - dependent community. It combines two types of communities. One consists of the high - cover blue grama / buffalo grass sod that looks like a golf course (high cover in patches). The other is the low - cover bare soil, Aristida , and forb stage, which could have taller grasses than the sod, but they are spaced apart due to bare soil between. See biomass in Milchunas et al. (1994) and Milchunas and Lauenroth (1989) and basal cover for sod class by point frame in Milchunas et al. (1989). There are relatively few cool - season grasses in this stage. There is always blue grama in this stage, as in the others. Cactus is present (and could even be a dominant in the C lass A sod depending on soil type). Aristida is present, which increases with prairie dog colonies. Annual grasses - - sixweeks fescue, r ed threeawn, ragweed, annual forbs. ( Currently, you would see non-native annuals in this class , such as cheatgrass and kochia - - only in the high biomass type , annuals and exotics are actually less abundant in the sod type than any other class [ Milchunas et al. 1989; Milchunas and Lauenroth 1989; Milchunas et al. 1988 ] ; the landscape might also have non-natives of bindweed on prairie dog towns today, but not historically. ) On loamier or sandier sites, there is sand dropseed. For the southern N ew Mexico version, other indicator species are lemonweed, showy goldeneye, verbena. Original draft model indicator species for the prairie dog stage also included ARPUL, AMPS, SPCR. Original indicator species for the sod stage also included OPPO. There are low - intensity fires in the low - biomass , high - cover sod and relatively rare fire in the low - biomass , low - cover bare soil. Fires are spotty through here and not as frequent as in other stages. This stage is produced by heavy grazing and long-term prairie dog colonies , which will maintain this stage long  term. This stage can also be maintained by heavy continuous grazing if the area is near water. Also ,  if an area is burned and grazed, the high - cover version of this stage will be reached if not continuously grazed. Grazing that gives adequate plant recovery periods occurs in this stage. It is thought that there should be ~ 20-30% of this stage historically, based on historical prairie dog communities combined with bison grazing (Gober 2000; David Augustine, USFS, pers onal comm unication ). However, the viewpoint that created this model feels that there is very little of this stage on the landscape today. Prairie dog plague today would also not allow this class to be maintained for long. Another opposing viewpoint feels that the sod portion of this class would have been a very small, localized condition historically and that today it would be very prevalent. This view states that historically there would just have been small areas of continuous grazing or migration corridors. This stage would also include buffalo wallows (Harvey Sprock, Terri Schulz, Rich Sterry et al., pers onal comm unication ). (Today, it might be go-back-cropland.) It is also thought, however, that today there are extensive areas of abandoned D ust B owl cropland that now have blue grama sod with low cover and productivity. The surface soil horizon is eroded by wind and is no longer apparent. Bedrock or subsoil/parent material is exposed in some areas (Harvey Sprock, Terri Schulz, Rich Sterry et al., pers onal comm unication ). This view is questioned, however, by others. Class A was originally modeled in the draft model as the prairie dog stage , as it would take a long time to move out of this stage due to the prairie dog communities. Class C was originally modeled as the sod class. Also the N ew Mexico draft older version had a cover of 0-20% for the prairie-dog-type  stage and the sod class with a cover of 41-50%."

Fire and grazing together can cause a state transition. Fire alone may not cause a transition but can especially on coarser - textured soils.

The stages of the grassland are created and/or maintained by disturbances or lack thereof. Class A is the low - biomass (0-1in based on the Robel pole density/visual obstruction method), heavy - disturbance - dependent community. It combines two types of communities. One consists of the high - cover blue grama / buffalo  grass sod that looks like a golf course (high cover in patches). The other is the low - cover bare soil, Aristida , and forb stage, which could have taller grasses than the sod, but they are spaced apart due to bare soil between. See biomass in Milchunas et al. (1994) and Milchunas and Lauenroth (1989) and basal cover for sod class by point frame in Milchunas et al. (1989). Please note that this system should be distinguished on  the  ground by biomass and not cover, since the cover in Cl ass A actually ranges from a low, mosaic-bare-ground cover to a high sod  cover, which includes litter , too. Due to mapping constraints, we are defining dropdown boxes on cover; however , this stage could go up to 70% cover, including litter, with very low biomass. Basal cover for high - cover sod is ~ 45% or higher if including litter. Basal cover for low - cover prairie dog area is ~ 20-25% cover. On  the  ground, this class should be distinguished by biomass. There are relatively few cool - season grasses in this stage. There is always blue grama in this stage, as in the others. Cactus is present (and could even be a dominant in the C lass A sod depending on soil type). Aristida is present, which increases with prairie dog colonies, as are the annual grasses - - sixweeks fescue, red threeawn, ragweed , and annual forbs. ( Currently, you would see non-native annuals in this class , such as cheatgrass and kochia - - only in the high - biomass type. Annuals and exotics are actually less abundant in the sod type than any other class [ Milchunas et al. 1989; Milchunas and Lauenroth 1989; Milchunas et al. 1988 ] ; the landscape might also have non-native bindweed on prairie dog towns today, but not historically. ) On loamier or sandier sites, there is sand dropseed. For the southern N ew Mexico version, other indicator species are lemonweed, showy goldeneye , and verbena. Original draft model indicator species for the prairie dog stage also included ARPUL, AMPS , and SPCR. Original indicator species for the sod stage also included OPPO. There are low - intensity fires in the low - biomass , high - cover sod and relatively rare fire in the low - biomass , low - cover bare soil. Fires are spotty through here and not as frequent as in other stages. They do not cause a change in stages. This stage is produced by heavy grazing  and long-term prairie dog colonies , which will maintain this stage long  term. This stage can also be maintained by heavy continuous grazing if the area is near water. Also if an area is burned and grazed, the high - cover version of this stage will be reached if not continuously grazed. Grazing that gives adequate plant recovery periods occurs in this stage. If there is no fire and no prairie dog or heavy grazing maintaining this stage ,  this stage will transition to the C lass B stage. This was model ed as ""alternate succession"" for modeling purposes. Drought occurs. It is thought that there should be ~ 20-30% of this stage historically, based on historical prairie dog communities combined with bison grazing (Gober 2000 ; David Augustine, USFS, pers onal comm unication ). However, the viewpoint that created this model feels that there is very little of this stage on the landscape today. Prairie dog plague today would also not allow this class to be maintained for long. Another opposing viewpoint feels that the sod portion of this class would have been a very small, localized condition historically and that today it would be very prevalent. This view states that historically there would just have been small areas of continuous grazing or migration corridors. This stage would also include buffalo wallows (Harvey Sprock, Terri Schulz, Rich Sterry et al., pers onal comm unication ). (Today, it might be go-back-cropland.) It is also thought , however, that today there are extensive areas of abandoned D ust B owl cropland that now have blue grama sod with low cover and productivity. The surface soil horizon is eroded by wind and is no longer apparent. Bedrock or subsoil/parent material is exposed in some areas (Harvey Sprock, Terri Schulz, Rich Sterry et al., pers onal comm unication ). This view is questioned, however, by others. Class A was originally modeled in the draft model as the prairie dog stage lasting 20yrs, as it would take a long time to move out of this stage due to the prairie dog communities. Class C was originally modeled as the sod class. Please note that the covers in the dropdown boxes in this system are arbitrary and are only being used for LANDFIRE mapping purposes. Please note that this system should be distinguished on  the  ground by biomass and not cover, since the cover in C lass A actually ranges from a low, mosaic-bare-ground cover to a high - sod  cover, which includes litter , too. Due to mapping constraints and past issues with mapping herbaceous cover and resultant errors, this C lass A is being set at 0-20% even though it was originally suggested to be 0-70%. Either way, these covers do not reflect reality on  the  ground. Remote sensing will show part of this stage as litter plus vegetation. Note that the N ew Mexico southern version had a canopy closure of 0-20% for the prairie-dog-type stage C lass A and 41-50% for the sod class."

Beaver were modeled as a replacement disturbance in MZ29 because they probably had a major impact on pre-settlement montane riparian forests. Many were â€œ trapped out â€ before settlers arrived . Where beaver are common, there are few large cottonwoods within 50m of the water, and most montane riparian zones would  n o t have been too much more than 100yds wide. This is opinion based on the Marias River (north-central Montana) and the fact that the Beaverhead River (southwest Montana) had no cottonwood when Lewis and Clark came through ( Lesica , pers . comm . ).

The understory vegetation is highly variable. Flooding occurs every 50yrs, and advances the class to the next stage; flooding promotes the class to the next stage by raising the level of the terrace.

However, it has been suggested that stand replacing fires might not occur in this class because it might be too wet for fire. However, due to lack of data, replacement fires were kept in the model. It is questionable as to whether replacement fire would set this stage back to class A, as the terrace would be too high and dry to provide conditions for successful establishment of cottonwood and willow from seed. If the cottonwoods resprouted , it would be more like class B because the understory would be more mature than class A; if the cottonwoods didn't resprout , it would probably just be a willow stand. Replacement fire was therefore modeled as taking this class to class B. Low severity and mixed fire also occur every 100yrs, combined, and does not transition to another stage.

11620_20,D,Late1:CLS,"This class is a mature, late seral closed canopy cottonwood floodplain forest. Overstory is dominated by cottonwood. (Original MZ20 modelers included box elder ACENEG in this class; however, all other reviewers disagreed and said that ACENEG was a minor component historically. It might be present, but in small amounts; chokecherry is more common; green ash is also not common in riparian cottonwood forests in this mapzone . Box elder, however, is seen today in the Musselshell/Missouri River, but it is questionable as to whether that would have occurred historically.) System becoming drier, so western wheatgrass coming in. Minor flooding occurs every 10-20yrs. Minor flooding raises the level of the terrace. Because this is the last stage in this cottonwood portion of the system, this minor flooding was modeled as wind/weather stress, causing no transition. Major flooding occurs every 50-100yrs, bringing this class back to class A. This was modeled as wind/weather stress. Replacement fire occurs every 150yrs (this interval is speculative, as not much data is available.) and takes this class to E, the silver sagebrush class. It is thought, however, that before it gets to silver sagebrush, there might be an intermediate stage dominated by western wheatgrass and snowberry before silver sagebrush establishes in significant amounts. However, due to the limitations of the five-box model, this intermediate stage was not modeled. Low severity fire was also modeled as it was in class C, causing no transition. Mixed severity fire was included with the same probability as low severity, every 100yrs. It is thought that mixed severity fire would cause a more open, drier stand that would allow invasion of silver sagebrush earlier, bringing it to E earlier; however, because that type of transition was captured in replacement fire, mixed severity fire was modeled as removing some of the overstory and thus causing a transition to C. Optional 2 in this class represents erosional processes of river meandering that would bring this class eventually back to class A. The class/system will first be part of the river, but then will succeed to class A or a point bar state.

11620_20,E,Late2:CLS,"This is a silver sagebrush climax community on river terraces and larger streams. It has been noted (Cooper, personal correspondence) that the usual case in this system is for plains cottonwood to die out and for the stand to go to silver sagebrush domination with western wheatgrass in the undergrowth or western snowberry and rose (Rosa spp ) with grasses (mostly PASSMI). That is what is modeled here. It is thought that before this stage gets to silver sagebrush, there might be an intermediate stage dominated by western wheatgrass and snowberry before silver sagebrush establishes in significant amounts. However, due to the limitations of the five-box model, this intermediate stage was not modeled. This class also represents the post-replacement fire community from D. If a replacement fire were to occur in D, it would come to this stage - which is why this stage therefore starts at age 50yrs. This is a stable community and it persists. Silver sagebrush resprouts after fire. This class is less likely to have depositional flooding than other stages. It was therefore not modeled here. Major flooding events were modeled as wind/weather stress occurring every 250yrs, bringing this class back to A. Optional 2 in this class represents erosional processes of river meandering that would bring this class eventually back to class A. The class/system will first be part of the river, but then will succeed to class A or a point bar state.

JUSC is tallied with the tree species, although it â€™ s an understory species in the closed forest.

Johnson (1992) states that young pioneer stands (<40yrs. old) comprised 47% of the forest historically."
11620_38,B,Mid1:CLS,"This stage develops as the stand starts to mature. This community tends to be partially opened, with scattered cottonwoods and willows. Sta nds of cottonwoods can be fairly dense , although there are usually some openings. The shrub layer is highly variable and may include species such as rose, snowberry, chokecherry, dogwood. Green ash begins to esta blish in cottonwood stands after a few decades ( Lesica and Miles 1999). The understory vegetation is hi ghly variable. This class succeeds to a late closed stage. Willows slow current and create deposition on top. The vegetation helps anchor and causes deposition which decreases flood frequency. Flooding leading to deposition occurs , promoting succession to the next stage by raising the level of the terrace (modeled as alternate succession). Major flooding also o ccurs also occurs as often bringing this class back to the early C lass A stage (modeled as wind/weather stress). Replacement fires were m odeled . It would probably only burn in drought, as fires would be very rare. It has been suggested that stand replacing fires might not occur in this class because it might be too wet for fire. However, due to lack of data, replacement fires were kept in the model. It is questionable whether replacement fire would set this stage back to the beginning of C lass A, as the terrace would be too high and dry to provide conditions for successful establishment of cottonwood and willow from seed. If the cottonwoods resprouted , it would be more like the middle of C lass A because the understory would be more mature than the beginning of C lass A; if the cottonwoods didn't resprout , it would probably just be a willow stand. Replacement fire was however modeled as taking this class to C lass A. Low severity and mixe d fire also occur and would not cause transition to another stage. Beaver disturbance occurs in this class. The closer to the river, the more likely it is. It was modeled as ""optional 1"". Beaver activity is quite variabl e. It was modeled infrequently , thus maintaining this class. It has been suggested that Native Americans likely burned (low severity fires) these ar eas more often . However, another reviewer questioned that and stated that they probably didnâ€™t burn these areas but rather the surrounding area, since this area would be too difficult to burn due to too much shade and humidity. Also, some sites were likely heavily grazed by bison (low severity fire sites) and horses near camps. However, the model was retained as is, as no confirming feedback was received."
11620_38,C,Late1:CLS,"This class is a mature, late seral closed canopy cottonwood floodplain forest. Overstory is dominated by cottonwood and green ash. Box elder is a frequent component of this class for MZs 39 and 40 but is not as common as green ash. (Some modelers/reviewers thought that the system is becoming drier in this class allowing western wheatgrass to come in; however, others questioned that.) Tree height maximum probably only goes to approximately 30-35m. Western portions will be shorter. Ecological studies along the Missouri River in central North Dakota have documented a similar successional pattern as that for at least four studies along the Missouri River in southeastern South Dakota, which have described aspects of a successional sequence that begins with colonization by cattails or sandbar willow, develops through transitional phases to a plains cottonwood dominated forest, and finally, in the absence of stand replacing floods, develops into a mixed deciduous forest containing aging cottonwoods, green ash, boxelder, bur oak (Johnson 1950, Heckel 1963, Wilson 1970), and American elm (Johnson, et al. 1976). (Ode 2004). This was therefore modeled as a successional pathway to C lass D. Some cottonwood stands follow the successional pathway and proceed to C lass Eâ€™s silver sage component, which was modeled as alternate succession. Others have enough green ash that the next class, in this case C lass D, is dominated by green ash and Symphoricarpos  occidentalis . Some stands would be a mosaic of these two late-seral types. This class can succeed to C lass D. This class probably only succeeds to C lass Eâ€™s silver sage component with high flood and not a frequent occurrence, thus for MZs 39 and 40, it was modeled as alternate succession instead of the main successional pathway as was done in Montana and western Dakota map  zones. Historically, this system might have even succeeded to juniper. When there is a 100-year flood and high sand deposits occur, cottonwoods die, and then dry stands occur. It is then too dry for green ash, so it might succeed to juniper. In these cases, it was islands â€“ so they were protected from fire. Those that would form on terraces would probably be affected by fire. But islands didnâ€™t burn and so juniper was retained. Note that the forest might not succeed to stage E in eastern South Dakota, and rather it might remain in C lass C or D. C lass E is more appropriate for western parts of the map zones where later successional species are scarcer. Mino r flooding occurs . Minor flooding raises the level of the terrace. Because this is the last stage in this cottonwood portion of the system, this minor flooding was modeled as wind/weather stress, causing no transition. Major flooding occurs bringing this class back to C lass A. This was modeled as wind/weather stress. Replace ment fire occurs and takes this class to C lass Eâ€™s silver sage component was originally modeled in Montana and western Dakota map zones . However, because that fire was speculative, and because review for MZs 39 and 40, it was thought that those events do not occur often, and because too much was thought to be going into Class E, that replacement fire was removed for MZs 39 and 40. It is thought that drought might convert this system to sagebrush, but that is speculative, and geographical climaxes vary. Low severity fire was also modeled as it was in C lass B, causing no transition. Mixed severity fire was also included with the same probabili ty as low severity . It is thought that mixed severity fire might cause a more open, drier stand that would allow invasion of silver sagebrush earlier, bringing it to E earlier; however, that was not modeled for MZs 39 and 40, as it is speculative. Optional 2 in this class represents erosional processes of river meandering that would bring this class eventually back to C lass A. The class/system will first be part of the river, but then will succeed to class A or a point bar state. This occurs with a frequency of several hundred years and was modeled . River meanders back and begins to cut away at the banks whereon a mature or old-growth stand of POPDEL exists and the living trees slowly are undercut and ultimately fall into the stream. Beaver disturbance occurs in this class. The closer to the river, the more likely it is. It was modeled as ""optional 1"". Beaver activity is quite variable and modeled as maintaining this class. Johnson (1992) states that older pioneer stands (40-80yrs. old) comprised 25% of the forest; that transitional forest (80-150yrs old) comprised 21% of the forested acreage and that equilibrium stands (dominated by green ash, elm, oak, etc.) (>150yrs. old) comprised only 7% of the forested acreage historically."
11620_38,D,Late2:CLS,"The trees are actually shorter as one moves west. Green ash and cottonwood in the central and western Dakotas are almost half the size of those in the Midwest . This class was based on R4NOFP class E. It is found along the upper terrace that has been protected from most flood events, except for rare high intensity flooding. Species composition increases towards south and east within the region. Overstory species include hackberry, green ash, and elm. Understory species include vines and poison ivy. In the absence of stand replacing floods, this class is what has developed - a mixed deciduous forest that may contain aging cottonwoods, green ash, American elm, boxelder, bur oak, and eastern redcedar (Johnson 1950, Heckel 1963, Wilson 1970), which is more prominent in the East but still present in the Dakotas. Ecological studies along the Missouri River in central North Dakota have documented a similar successional pattern ultimately resulting in a forest dominated by green ash, boxelder, bur oak, and American elm (Johnson, et al. 1976). ( F rom Ode 2004). Class Dâ€™s components of hackberry, slippery elm and bur oak are present downstream from Yankton in the Dakotas. These species occur in central to eastern N orth Dakota. In western N orth D akota (and probably much of western S outh D akota, too) species are green ash, American elm, boxelder and eastern redcedar and Juniperus  scopulorum . Hansen et al. (1984) state that other dominants are Toxicodendron  rydbergii and Elymus canadensis. The FRPE/SYOC association is an edaphic climax on the floodplain adjacent to the Little Missouri River and its major tributaries. PODE currently dominates many stands but is no longer reproducing. It will be replaced by FRPE. The larger trees, some 6-7dm DBH are PODE, but the young trees establishing in the stands are FRPE. JUSC is tallied with the tree species, although it's an understory species in the closed forest. Its current abundance is attributed to adequate light penetrating to the shrub and herb layers of the c ommunity  as a result of wide spacing of the old Populus . Along the Missouri River, in central N orth D akota , southest S outh D akota , and near Omaha, N ebraska , PODE is a pioneer species and is replaced successionally by various combos of Fraxinus , Ulmus , Acer, and Celtis . Among the grasses, CALO, ELCA, MURA are important (Hansen et al . 1984). The disturbances are those from R4NOFP: Major flooding events ca n bring this class back to A, modeled as wind/weather stress. Flooding events can also cause a transition back to C modeled as wind/weather stress. Mixed fire occurs but causes no transition. Dominants of the green ash/western snowberry stands can resprout after fire. However, a very hot fire can kill the green ash ( Lesica 2003), in which case it would probably become a stand of western snowberry-silver sagebrush-western wheatgrass (not modeled here)."
11620_38,E,Late3:CLS,"Note that the forest might not succeed to this stage E in eastern South Dakota, and rather it might remain in Class C or D. Class E is more appropriate for western parts of the map zones where later successional species are scarcer. This stage in Montana and western Dakotas map zones was modeled as a silver sagebrush community. For MZs 39 and 40, it is thought that there are a few historical alternative ends, of which silver sage is only one. Therefore, stage E is a combination of the alternative ends. Silver sage is a common terrace shrub, but the events causing this system to move there are infrequent, and therefore the previous 25% in this Class E from Montana map zones did not apply in the Dakotas. Another alternative end is this system going to Juniper. These are examples of where the successional path might take a different turn due to rare flood events or geographically varying climaxes and variations dependent on habitat. The cedar stage/forest is also another stage that might have been present historically but not anymore , in all stages of this system (Dave Ode, personal communication ). The silver sagebrush climax community occurs on river terraces and along larger streams. It has been noted (Steve Cooper, personal correspondence) that the usual case in this system is for plains cottonwood to die out and for the stand to go to silver sagebrush domination with western wheatgrass in the undergrowth or western snowberry and rose ( Rosa  spp ) with grasses (mostly PASSMI). That is what is therefore modeled here. It is thought that before this stage gets to silver sagebrush, there might be an intermediate stage dominated by western wheatgrass and snowberry before silver sagebrush establishes in significant amounts. However, due to the limitations of the 5-box model, this intermediate stage was not modeled. This stage starts at a late age to account for the low probability of the alternate successional pathway from C. This class is less likely to have depositional flooding than other stages. It was therefore not modeled here. Major flooding events were modeled as wind/weathe r stress occurs a brings this class back to A. Optional 2 in this class represents erosional processes of river meandering that would bring this class eventually back to Class A. The class/system will first be part of the river, but then will succeed to Class A or a point bar state. This occurs with a frequency of se veral hundred year s. Replacement f ire was modeled similar to other silver sage communities, but maintaining this stage, as this class is stable, and the silver sagebrush resprouts and thus maintains this stage. Note for mappers: although height and cover overlap with Class A, species are completely different. This is no longer a PODE3 community. It is thought that this stage might be more prevalent currently vs historically due to impoundments increasing the silver sage distribution. It is questionable as to how much this class occupied of the historic landscape. In Montana and western Dakota zones, it was modeled as 25%; however, it was thought that that was too much for the Dakotas. Johnson (1992) states that older pioneer stands (40-80yrs. old) comprised 25% of the forest; that transitional forest (80-150yrs old) comprised 21% of the forested acreage and that equilibrium stands  (dominated by green ash,  elm, oak, etc.) (>150yrs.old) comprised only 7% of the forested acreage historically."

Severe drought, modeled as wind/weather/stress would also limit tree and shrub establishment and maintain this class. This class lasts for the estimated time it would take for shrubs to become the dominant lifeform, although they are still present in this stage. Shrubs and aspen suckers would most likely establish during this stage if there is a nearby seed source or aspen grove. However, shrubs are nearly always a component as aspen establishes. It is noted, however, that woody vegetation instantly is an important component following a fire. Aspen suckers, oak grubs and shrubs survive and resprout immediately. Note that it would take a long time for prairie species to reinvade an area that had developed to this forest type if somehow fire would become frequent enough to prevent the regrowth of the forest. The situation would be different for areas that were open woodland ; the prairie grasses, etc., are usually fairly common in these, and stand-removing fire results in a luxuriant growth of these. Class A, a wetland with little shrub component and mostly sedge, would probably have encompassed 15-20% of the landscape. Class A combined with class B (prairie and brush prairie communities) encompassed probably approximately 60-70% of the historical landscape."
13310_39_40_41,B,Mid1:ALL,"This class represents a brush prairie stage dominated by shrubs such as willows, American and beaked hazelnut, chokecherry, juneberry, viburnum, rose and poison-ivy. Young aspens and oaks would also be present in this class. This is a prairie/brush prairie (wet/dry) and oak savanna maintained by fairly frequent fires of varying intensity. Oaks might also be an indicator species.  As microclimates, climate and disturbance allow, aspen establishes and/or encroaches, especially from established clones and around wetlands. These small trees are seen in this class. They take 10-15yrs to establish, and the older they are, the more intense the fire needs to be. Co-RL for MZs 39 and 40 questioned whether or not the cover would go all the way up to 100% Tree cover might also be 0-5m up to 20% cover. Replacement fires would occur and would change stature but wouldn't revert the class back to the early seral stage with just one fire. It would take 3-5 replacement fires in a 10-15yr period to revert this class back to early seral . Since percentage probabilities cannot be modeled in LANDFIRE , this was converted to an approximate every 40yrs this would occur. However, it is noted that even such an event would still leave some shrubs reduced in stature and less abundant. Woody vegetation instantly is an important component following a stand-destroying fire. The fire does not de s troy the roots of most, and aspen suckers, oak grubs, and shrubs survive and resprout immediately. By the second year following fire, the vegetation is more like a shrub thicket than a grassland. It takes several years of fires in quick succession to push the woody component down relative to the herbaceous.  A low intensity surface fire will not topkill 10-15yr old aspen. The other shrub species (willow, birch and hazel) do not seem to behave this way. Drought occurs but generally does not result in a change in seral stage. For this class combined with class A encompassing the open sedge, prairie and brush prairie communities and classes, they both encompassed probably approximately 60-70% of the historical landscape. This class B itself as the prairie/brush prairie and oak savanna would encompass approximately 55-65% of the landscape."
13310_39_40_41,C,Late1:ALL,"This class represents a woodland stage with a patchy canopy of trembling aspen with bur oak; there are a very few areas of jack pine and white spruce associates. Large, mature aspen would occur in this stage, but even these are not the dense forests we often see now, but rather more open woodland with herbaceous and shrub layers. They seemed to be small in size with large mature trees of the clone radiating out with suckers and trees of dwindling stature. These trees are fairly short-lived and individuals seldom reach more than 60yrs today. The clone, on the other hand, can have a very long life. Fire can also set this class back to a form of class B or maintain this class C. This was modeled as replacement fire half the time causing a transition to B, and surface fire half the time maintaining this stage, occurring with an overall interval of 6yrs . This replacement fire is modeled as setting this stage back to B and not A because the regen on aspen is almost immediate, and three foot saplings the growing season following a fire are common. These will often be more abundant than would be found at the encroachment zone and would have much more energy in the root reserves from which to draw. After a stand replacement fire in aspen or willow, there is immediate regrowth often with increased stem density. It would take multiple fires at short intervals to set things back to the grass shrubs. Replacement fires would occur and would change stature but wouldn't revert the class back to class A with just one fire. It would take 3-5 replacement fires in a 10-15yr period to revert this class back to class A. Since percentage probabilities cannot be modeled in LANDFIRE, this was converted to an approximate every 40yrs this type of replacement fire would occur. However, it is noted that even such an event would still leave some shrubs reduced in stature and less abundant. Oaks are very difficult to set back, and they were probably fairly abundant here. There were probably quite a few scattered savannas and open woodlands while aspen clones were smaller in size and much more likely to shift due to disturbance over a shorter timeframe. Catastrophic wind would set the system back to the early seral stage, and drought maintain this system in this class although it could also lead to some aspen die-back. (Some felt that Insect/disease such as a canker fungus could infect an entire aspen grove; however this was questioned by review and therefore removed from the model). I t is thought that aspen would har dly reach 70yrs before die-off, but oaks might persist for longer . The GLO and historical references indicate few trees, most small and stunted; therefore, it is thought that this stage would occupy approximately 15-30% of the landscape historically, although it might occupy more currently due to encroachment."

The oak layer is really the dominant layer here but canopy closure and min/max height is very similar to the tree layer as trees are just starting to be recruited. 0-30% canopy closer; 0.6-1m height."
13820_55_58,B,Mid1:CLS,"Mid-closed. Pines still present, but now the needle layer that fuels the fires is shaded out by increase in oak density and height. Fires now are either patchy or stand-replacement, which may or may not kill the existing pines based on the other stresses in the system, including salt and hurricanes. Patchy, incomplete fires tend to keep this class as it is, but more than likely it will succeed to a class which is denser oaks and has no pine regeneration at all. Upper Layer Lifeform is not the dominant lifeform. The oak layer is really the dominant layer here but canopy closer is very similar to the tree layer as oaks continue to persist and grow in the absence of fire. 0-40% canopy closure; 1.1-3.1m height."
13820_55_58,C,Mid1:OPN,"Mid-open. Mixed larger pines, with low oak levels and density. With regular fires , class C will remain stable, since larger pines provide the necessary needle litter for fuel. Fires are patchy, and spread from needles to palmettos and oaks present. Upper Layer Lifeform is not the dominant lifeform. The oak layer is really the dominant lifeform, but the pines have shot above the oak layer. 0-40% canopy closure; 0.6-1m height."
13820_55_58,D,Late1:OPN,"Late open. Oaks will fill in the gaps and grow much more quickly than herbaceous species, and so this class will be comprised of oaks, with potential for pine recruitment in open patches. Not much chance for fire here, since major fuel (needles, palmettos) are lacking ."
13820_55_58,E,Late1:CLS,"Late closed. Large, dense oaks will be the dominant vegetation . The intense fire from this class should kill many oaks, and allow for pine seedling recruitment from nearby areas. Many examples of this ecosystem in urban settings are comprised of this class."
13830_32_35_36,A,Early1:ALL,"Even though there are trees and shrubs in this class, their cover is < 10% , and therefore the herb layer is considered the upper - layer lifeform here. Class A includes the first few y ears after a burn , and fine fuels are expected to green up within one growing season and be attractive to grazers. By the end of C lass A, in normal years, fine fuels would be well developed but little thatch would have built up. Replacement fire is a frequent disturbance in this type . This condition includes sparse to moderate cover of mid - to tallgrasses and forbs with a scattered canopy of trees and shrubs resprouting. Woody cover of resp routing shrubs and trees is sparse . This class would also have some cover that is comprised of bare rock. The mosaic on the landscape would have open areas of bare rock, thin soil areas with some bare ground , and discontinuous grass cover and then other areas with more continuous grass cover. Grass cover varies from primarily tallgrasses (dominated by little bluestem, Indiangrass, switchgrass, Texas wintergrass, Texas cupgrass, silver bluestem, cane blustem, lovegrass, and big bluestem) to midgrasses (dominated by sideoats grama, blue grama, hairy tridens, threeawns, and sand dropseed), but shortgrass areas (dominated by curly-mesquite, buffalograss, and tobosa) persist on very droughty or shallow soils and in the western parts of the region. Grasses grade from taller grasses in the eastern part of the region to shortgrasses in the western part of the region. Also , some evidence suggests that taller grasses are present on the slopes where more water is available in the cracks than on the upland flats where more soil is developed but the soils are more droughty (Fowler 1988). The combination of severe drought and grazing will reduce fine fuels and therefore fire frequency."
13830_32_35_36,B,Mid1:CLS,"Class B is comprised of a closed canopy shrubland wi th shrub and small tree cover and a sparse to moderate herbaceous understory. Cover of mid - t o tallgrasses and forbs is moderate . Scattered larger trees may be present but with low cover . This class would also h ave low cover that is comprised of bare rock. This class persisted in the historic landscape in patches (shinneries) in a mosaic with grasslands, woodlands , and forests. Bigelow oak is the predominant shrub in the shrublands, along with Texas mountain laurel, Texas kidney wood, Texas persimmon, evergreen sumac, lotebush, Brazilian bluewood, Texas colubrina, Mexican buckeye, algerita ( Berberis trifoliata ) , and stretchberry ( Forestiera pubescens ). After shrubs primarily of bastard oak ( Quercus sinuata var. breviloba ) are established, the shrubland physiognomy can be maintained with periodic fire. In the absence of fire, the shrublands are expected to succeed and mature into a closed canopy forest. Fire and grazing are the d ominant disturbance types."

It is maintained by fires of mixed intensity. Surface fires keep the wooded patches from expanding. Trees, present as scattered individuals and larger clumps (oak mottes) , cover a moderate area . This class could also have low cover of bare rock. Species composition is similar to C lass C , with a greater diversity of trees ( U. crassifolia , C. laevigata var. reticulata , J. ashei ) occupying the mottes due to the lowered fire effect in the mottes. Herbaceous composition is similar to classes A and C. Fire and grazing ar e the dominant disturbance types. Native grazing (and browsing) a nd resource competition keep resprouting low."

Studies have shown that fuel moisture is higher under live oak ( Q. virginiana ) canopies than post oak canopies or open grassland (Fonteyn e t al. 1988). In a landscape subjected to fire, J. ashei is more likely to occur in combination with other trees, especially live oak, where it will be protected from fire, than individually. Replacement fires in C lass E would only be expected during extreme drought years and possibly with summer fires (Fonteyn et al. 1988). Fire will occur rarely in this class."

This class may occur following a disturbance such as a hurricane, sand burial, overwash or a fire event. Vegetation resprouts from roots, corms or seeds. On the oak/rosemary dominated dune ridges, the dominant vegetation in class A is the resprouting shrubs which may comprise up to 30% cover. In the pine - dominated swales and flats the dominant vegetation in this class is the herbaceous groundcover and resprouting shrubs. Hurricanes and other wind/weather related disturbances may impact this class several times per century, either through sand burial, overwash or erosion. Light surface fires probably occurred in the pine dominated swales every four years. Replacement fires were less frequent in the pine dominated swales, and probably occurred following a hurricane event that increased the amount of downed available fuel. The probability of the oak/rosemary dominated dune ridges burning in this class are low due to the lack of fine fuels and low fuel continuity."

14140_57,A,Early1:ALL,"This is the grass bald. Vegetation is herbaceous graminoid, predominantly native grasses and sedges ( Carex spp.). The graminoid vegetation is thick and there is a significant thatch or duff layer of grass between the actively growing green leaves and the soil surface. This thick dominance of grasses and sedges provides a competitive advantage to the graminoids, and limits the ability for woody plant seeds to germinate. Grazing has kept these sites open in the period from European settlement until the first half of the 20th century when land managing agencies acquired lands and grazing ceased. Since that time shrubs and then trees have encroached into the grassy balds , with the loss of grassy balds due to the invasion by shrubs and trees at about 1-2%/year (Lindsay & Bratton 1980). There is little evidence of charcoal in the soil; fire is difficult to ignite in the moist environment and the effect of fire has not enhanced an open grassy condition in several management trials (Barden 1978, Lindsay & Bratton 1979, Murdock 1986, White & Sutter 1999). Association of grassy balds with N ative American use or the grazing of native large herbivores (Elk, Woodland Bison, and even Pleistocene megafauna) is a common factor in the explanation of the persistence of grassy balds in the pre-settlement landscape (Wells 1936, Wells 1937, Wiegl & Knowles 1999). This is incorporated into the VDDT model as lack of grazing (alternative succession) leading to class C. Another factor in the distribution of the grassy balds is the association with high elevation springs (Wells 1936, Wells 1937) which could have attracted native grazers and native Americans, and were certainly an important factor in the selection of sites for livestock grazing by white settlers."

In the absence of any disturbance for an extended period, these balds may transit ion to other classes . According to White, Wilds and Stratton (2001), ""Heath balds are distinctive in structure and composition: they have a 1-2m tall evergreen canopy, deep leaf litter, very acidic A-horizons (Cain 1931), low species richness, and a mostly woody flora (ca. 15 woody species, 12 of which are in Ericaceae , and five herbaceous species; P. White unpublished). Dominants include Rhododendron maximum, R. catawbiense , R. minus, Kalmia latifolia , and Leiophyllum  buxifolium . Heath balds are abruptly bounded by much taller forests and thus are easily mapped. Comparison of selected heath balds on 1930s and 1980s aerial photographs showed no changes in area (P. White unpublished); past studies have also treated these communities as stable (Whittaker 1956; Cain 1930b). There are almost no tree seedlings established in heath balds because of the dense evergreen canopy and the thick, acidic leaf litter. Productivity in heath balds is low (Whittaker 1961, 1962).""

14200_39_40_42,A,Early1:ALL,"This is the post-fire, post-grazing community from immediately after a replacement fire until one year after the fire. Immediately following the fire, there are no above ground plants and no litter. Plants emerge within weeks and typically, within a year, the grasses range from 1-1.75m high. For a spring burn, ideally this stage would only last three months; therefore, this stage was modeled to end at one year. This also represents the post-grazing stage with grasses and forbs grazed and kept to a low stature. Graminoids are abundant but the forb component is higher in this stage than others. Dominant species are those common to the Northern Tallgrass Prairie - Andropogon  gerardii , Panicum virgatum , Koeleria  macrantha , and Stipa  spartea ; they are present but much shorter and in somewhat less abundance. Some forbs are more abundant in the immediate post-fire vegetation. There w as a wide diversity of early successional forbs, such as Artemisia ludoviciana and Ambrosia artemisifolia . Carex spp. a re also present in the lower layer. Annual burns and sometimes two burns in a single year (spring burns can easily be followed by fall, dormant season burns) can occur in some spots. For fire (and to some extent grazing) in pre-European times, there really are only two basic stages : (1) immediately after the fire , until fuel accumulates , and (2) any time after a yearâ€™s growth has accumulated as fuel and it is available for fire . (One can make further subdivisions , such as the time until fuel accumulates to pre-burn conditions , but this is difficult to identify , is not easily mapped , and is not an important factor in burning since a fire can occur with only one growing seasonâ€™s fuel accumulation. ) It seems that historically, any portion of the map  zone that did not burn would have succeeded to trees some time ago and that, theoretically, there would be little if any of this sere in the pre-European landscape. Subsequent stages occur today in the absence of historic disturbances. Further, fires in class A would not have substantially changed the community composition. In this ecosystem a â€œreplacementâ€ fire only removes litter and some standing plant matter, it does not change composition (except for uncommon annuals)."

Both of these occur more commonly in the eastern parts of this Type. Dominant species are still those common to the Northern Tallgrass Prairie - Andropogon  gerardii , Panicum virgatum , Sorghastrum  nutans and Stipa  spartea .

The result is permanent, established woody areas in protected areas but with less of the landscape transitioning to this class. Historically, w oody plants were not reported to be expanding their range. Sites in this class are beyond the normal fire return interval.

Pioneer species such as sea oats tend to respond positively to moderate sand burial. Wagner (1964) found that after burial in a controlled greenhouse experiment with 3in of sand, the buried sea oats were not appreciably different from the controls after 11 months. However, extreme disturbance events may require a longer recovery period. Reynolds (1976) reported on the effects of an extreme storm event where Manasota Key was extended southward 0.6 km.

Poor fens occur in peatlands where the peat surface is nearly isolated from mineral-rich runoff and is becoming increasingly acidic (pH is 4.2-5.5). Poor fens can develop through the acidification of wet meadows. This can occur in basins and on floating mats where invasion and accumulation of Sphagnum elevates the surface peat, isolating plant roots from underlying minerotrophic water. Upper Layer Lifeform is not the dominant lifeform. The herb/moss lifeform or the shrub lifeform are the dominant lifeform. Moss cover is nearly always 100%.

14820_39_40,A,Early1:ALL,"This class is dominated by resprouts and seedlings of grasses and post-fire associated forbs with low to medium height with variable canopy cover. In the deep marsh, it is 50% vegetated and 50% open water. For previous mapzones such as MZ30 or MZ20, previous modelers might have been thinking that the low vegetative cover should be modeled because part was open water. However, for MZs 39 and 40, there is a different view as to how this should be modeled. In shallow potholes, there is high vegetative cover. If there is deep water, there would actually be a zone of cattails surrounding. If the basin is flooded, this drowns out all vegetation. When it drops down, it will go without vegetation until the appropriate environment starts, and then vegetation will generate (although currently cattail will regenerate creating a monoculture â€“ which is a different endpoint than that which would have happened historically). The flood event kills deep marsh vegetation, then the water recedes and almost has to go down to nothing for the vegetation to become re-established. With seedling established on wet areas and not standing water in the basin, emergent plants will grow. Water will then return, and then the pothole will be an interspersed emergent vegetation and open water mosaic. Over time, it will become denser with vegetation. The smaller the basin, probably the q uicker the cycling might occur. Drought will affect large amounts of the area. Fire would cause little change in species composition except possible a temporary decline in Puccinellia and Hordeum (bunch grasses). Native grazi ng and herbivory could be heavy. Since this is a wetland community, it is thought that fire would impact the landscape much less frequently. The fire frequency would vary dependent on type of pothole. Temporary wetlands/potholes burned more frequently â€“ probably as often as a grassland since they only had water for a short period and then they dry up. The larger ones probably have water most of the time and would not burn because they would be full of water. Also, after a flood, the flood might have killed the vegetation and then the fire frequency wouldnâ€™t be high, because there would be no vegetation for fuels. (For example, around Miller, South Dakota, big basins flooded, and now they are dry because no more vegetation is there â€“ Dave Ode, pers . comm.). There would only be a few phases where the potholes would be susceptible to fire â€“ for instance, when there is vegetation and when it is dry and during drought."

The easily recognized low canopy of the reddish photosynthetic stems of Salicornia spp. is usually dominant for the first few months after disturbance, with other species becoming more both common and more obvious with time. Other species frequently found in recently disturbed areas of salt marsh include Suaeda  maritima , Salsola kali , Liimonium  carolinianum , Triglochin  maritima , and Distichlis  spicata . Species composition varies, apparently in response to differences in soil saturation, soil nutrient availability (especially nitrogen), and salinity."

After a few  y ea rs it all but eliminates the annuals that first colonize bare soils in the marsh and forms dense, low stands. These stands may appear to contain nothing by D. spicata , but on close examination, they usually retain so me remnant forbs . Other salt marsh grasses, especially S. patens , gradually increase in abundance until this community is replaced by typical high marsh vegetation. In the low marsh, Spartina alterniflora is among the first species to recolonize disturbed areas. However, Distichlis  spicata can survive in the low marsh environment. Recently disturbed sites thus may show an increase in the relative abundance of D. spicata in comparison to undisturbed low marsh. Abundance of D. spicata is highly variable."
